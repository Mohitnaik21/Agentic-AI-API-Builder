You'll need to create those API endpoints yourself.  A simple example for one endpoint might be:\\n\\n    ```python\\n    from fastapi import FastAPI\\n    app = FastAPI()\\n\\n    @app.get(\\\"/weather-api\\\")\\n    async def weather_api():\\n        return {\\\"temperature\\\": 25, \\\"condition\\\": \\\"Sunny\\\"}\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Install React and necessary packages:**  You'll need to have a React project set up.  If not, use `create-react-app`:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npx create-react-app my-weather-app\\n    cd my-weather-app\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  **Replace the placeholder API URLs** if your FastAPI server is running on a different address or port.\\n\\n4.  **Import and render the component** in your main app file (e.g., `App.js` or `src/App.js`):\\n\\n    ```jsx\\n    import React from 'react';\\n    import WeatherData from './WeatherData'; // Adjust path as needed\\n\\n    function App() {\\n      return (\\n        <div className=\\\"App\\\">\\n          <WeatherData />\\n        </div>\\n      );\\n    }\\n\\n    export default App;\\n    ```\\n\\n5.  **Run the React app:**\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm start\\n    ```\\n\\n\\nThis improved version handles errors more gracefully, displaying error messages from each API call individually, and uses `pre` tags for better formatting of JSON responses.  Remember to adjust file paths as needed for your project structure.  The error handling assumes the API returns a JSON object with an `error` property or a string message. You might need to adjust this based on your actual error responses.\\n\"\n",
